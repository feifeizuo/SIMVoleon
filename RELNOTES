RELEASE NOTES
=============

This file describes notable changes in the SIM Voleon library in a
more elaborate way than can be fit into to the compact NEWS summary
file.

The changes described here are issues that might have an effect on the
compatibility of your source code when upgrading the library.


SIM Voleon 1.1.0
================

* A major semantic change was made from version 1.0.0: data was
  flipped (i.e. upside-down) on the Y axis. This bug was fixed for
  version 1.1.0, but older client code may depend on this bug being
  present, by having work-arounds for the bug which expect Y-flipped
  data.

  We suggest upgrading older client code by either removing the
  work-arounds, or by setting the environment variable

        CVR_USE_FLIPPED_Y_AXIS=1

  ..which will preserve the old, buggy behavior. Note however that we
  expect to remove support for the old behavior with the next major
  release (i.e. SIM Voleon release 2.0.0).


* SoVolumeDataElement obsoleted.

  This element is no longer used, and will be removed from the public
  interface from the next major release. It is unlikely that any
  client code was using this element, but if so, get in touch at
  <coin-support@coin3d.org> to get information about how to handle
  this change.
