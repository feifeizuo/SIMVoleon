New in SIM Voleon v2.0.0:

* new features
  - SoObliqueSlice node
  - SoVolumeFaceSet, SoVolumeIndexedFaceSet, SoVolumeTriangleStripSet
    and SoVolumeIndexedTriangleStripSet nodes
  - SoVolumeSkin node

* bugfixes
  - data was previously rendered flipped on the Y axis, now fixed --
    note that this is a major semantic change which needs client code
    to be updated, see the RELNOTES document
  - 3D-texture based rendering for SoVolumeRender nodes now works
    correctly for any preceding scene graph transformations
  - many minor bugfixes
