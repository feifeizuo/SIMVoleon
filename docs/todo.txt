This document contains various ideas for improvements that we wish to
do with the library. Which ones are prioritized depends on user
requests, availability of programmer resources, and external and
internal funding.

============================================================================

000 Generate 2D lines and/or 3D contours from voxel data.

    Can be done by applying the Marching Cubes (or Squares?)
    algorithm, using coloring from the transfer function.

    We've had external requests for this.

001 Software rendering by ray casting.

    Various techniques that are really hard to do with GL texturing
    can be straight forward to implement if we can do visualization by
    ray casting, like for instance lighting, other intensity
    projections (in addition to maximum and sum), and probably many
    other things.

    Ray casting may also make dynamic level-of-detail a possibility..?

    NOTE: The new generation of hardware from NViDIA (Geforce 6800)
    has support for the GLSLang language which enables (in theory) the
    user to create a raycast program which is executed on the
    card. This is mentioned in a presentation by NViDIA;

============================================================================

002 Better rendering performance by using the "big image" scaling from
    Coin.

    Should try to scale textures to nothing larger than the necessary
    size, considered in the context of projected screen-space
    resolution (i.e. most texels are most often not shown, because
    they are projected together with many more to one screen pixel --
    so the textures could be smaller, with no loss of visual quality).

    Could perhaps prove to be too CPU intensive, given the large
    number of large textures for a typical volume, but should at least
    investigate this.

============================================================================

003 Support for "roaming" inside large volumes.

    Implement support for the TGS's SoROI node, to make it possible to
    use larger volumes than what is really supported by the available
    memory and rendering resources on the host machine.

    Will need a bit of internal redesign of some interfaces, as we can
    no longer just pass around a pointer to the full voxel
    block. Also, to support this properly, we would need to be able to
    read parts of volume data files.

============================================================================

004 Correct rendering of multiple (possibly intersecting), non-opaque
    volumes in the same scene.

    TGS supports this through their SoVolumeGroup node. We should have
    something similar. Actually, if we can implement this with a
    negligible performance hit, it would be better to do it _without_
    forcing the app programmer to use something like the TGS
    SoVolumeGroup, but instead just let it implicitly, transparently
    work.

    This can be done in various "stages" of complexity: first of all,
    we should support it for co-planar slices in 3D-textures normal to
    the view direction (this is the extent of what TGS
    supports).

    Next, it would be really cool if we clipped the polygons against
    each other, so rendering of partly transparent "volume-mapped"
    polygons in any direction would always look correct against each
    other. This would probably be difficult to always behave with
    decent performance, though.

============================================================================

005 Proper support for 16-bit / 2-byte voxel data.

    Currently, these are simply downsampled to 8-bit data. Should
    handle 16-bit voxel values "natively".

    Need to investigate to what degree something like this is
    supported both by RGBA and paletted textures from OpenGL's
    perspective.

============================================================================

006 A framework for writing out volume data.

    For dumping SoVolumeData (memory) contents to file, in various
    formats.
