Installation of the SIM Voleon library from source code is done in the
same manner as for other SIM libraries, for more information see the
"building instructions":http://www.coin3d.org/building/
on the Coin3D developer pages.


Requirements

	SIM Voleon's only dependency is simply that the Coin library
	must already have been installed. If that has been done on your
	system, simply follow the instructions for doing a "configure;
	make; make install" installation procedure.
