Installation of the SIM Voleon library from source code is done in the
same manner as for other SIM libraries, see the following link:

    http://www.coin3d.org/getting_started/building/

SIM Voleon's only dependency is simply that the Coin library must
already have been installed. If that has been done on your system,
simply follow the instructions for doing a "configure; make; make
install" installation procedure.
