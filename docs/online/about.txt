SIM Voleon is a software development system, in the form of an add-on
library to "Coin3D":http://www.coin3d.org/. SIM Voleon complements
Coin's capabilities for polygon-based rendering with visualization of
volumetric data sets, by providing so-called "volume rendering"
technology.

Some words about volumetric data

  Volumetric data is often the natural format to use for various
  purposes in scientific and engineering visualization process.
  This is often due to how data is collected from such equipment.

  One example is seismic data from measurements below the sea-
  floor, as done in the oil & gas industry to locate pockets of
  hydrocarbons. Another example is medical scanning equipment,
  from sources such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR/MR),
  Computer Tomography (CT) and ultrasound. These data collection
  methods gathers data in the form of point measurements, which
  does not always lend itself well to visualization in the form of
  polygon primitives.


About SIM Voleon

  SIM Voleon provides the technology to render such volumetric
  data sets, to modify their color mappings and transparency
  settings to e.g. visualize internal structures, to interact with
  the data (for querying positions and data values), and to
  integrate volume data with the traditional polygon-based
  geometric primitives of the core Coin library.

  The framework for employing the SIM Voleon library is the same
  as for ordinary Coin applications: SIM Voleon provides a set of
  new scene graph nodes to supplement Coin with the new
  capabilities of volume rendering.

  This makes it a straight-forward task to add basic volume
  rendering to your application, and the data can easily be
  manipulated through existing interaction features, like
  manipulators, viewers and widgets.

Highlighted features:

  - Easy integration with Coin3D applications

  - 3D texture support using viewport-aligned slicing

  - 2D texture support using object-aligned slicing

  - Volume data is separated into optimal subcubes enabling large
    datasets

  - Dynamic color lookup tables for voxel colors

  - Maximum intensity projection through hardware acceleration
